# ☕ Chai aur React - YouTube Series Notes & Projects

This repository contains my personal notes, projects, and practice code as I follow the **Chai aur React** series by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://hiteshchoudhary.com/). The course is an in-depth React JS roadmap aimed at helping developers understand and master React from scratch to production-ready concepts.

## 📺 About the Course

This YouTube series is hosted by **Chai aur Code**, a popular channel by Hitesh Choudhary. It covers everything from React fundamentals to advanced concepts, including Redux, Context API, Tailwind CSS, custom hooks, React Router, and even backend integration with Appwrite.
