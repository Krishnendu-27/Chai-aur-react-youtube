# 📘 React Roadmap – Lecture 1 Notes

---

## 🤔 Why Learn React?

- Makes it easy to manage and build **complex frontends**.
- Helps in creating dynamic user interfaces with better performance.
- React simplifies UI development by efficiently updating and rendering the right components.

---

## ⏱️ When Should You Learn React?

- After completing **JavaScript fundamentals and challenges**.
- Once you're comfortable with JavaScript, React is a great next step.
- At the end of the day, **React compiles down to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🛠️ Why Was React Created?

- In vanilla JavaScript, changing something on the page often **refreshes the whole DOM**, which slows down the application.
- React uses a **Virtual DOM**. When something changes:

  - It updates the Virtual DOM.
  - React compares the Virtual DOM with the Real DOM.
  - Only the changed part is updated in the Real DOM.

- This makes the page faster and more efficient.
- **JavaScript manages state**, and **the DOM handles UI**. React was designed to **sync JS with the DOM** smoothly.
- **Dan Abramov**, one of React’s creators, introduced this concept.
- **Khan Academy** was one of the first to adopt React.

## 📚 React is a Library (Not a Framework)

### 🧱 Difference Between a Library and a Framework

| Library                                              | Framework                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Gives you **freedom** to structure your app your way | Comes with **strict rules** and structure |
| You control the flow                                 | The framework controls the flow           |
| Example: React                                       | Example: Angular                          |

## 🧩 Key Topics to Learn

### 🔹 Core React Concepts

- **Component Reusability**: Break down UI into reusable components.
- **Props (Properties)**: Pass data between components.
- **Hooks**: Propagate and manage state or lifecycle in function components.

### 🔹 Single Page Application (SPA)

- React is used to create **SPAs**, where page reloads are avoided.

### 🔹 Routing in React

- **React doesn't include routing by default**.
- Use libraries like `react-router-dom` for routing.

### 🔹 State Management

- React does **not have built-in state management** for global state.
- Can use external libraries like Redux, Zustand, Recoil, etc.

## ☁️ Backend as a Service (BaaS) + React Projects

Great practice projects:

- **Social Media Clone**
- **E-Commerce Website**
- Combine React with BaaS like Firebase, Supabase, etc., to handle backend features like authentication, database, and storage.

## ☁️ After react

- backend , nextjs
